```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown Practice



```{r, echo=FALSE}

enrollment <- read.csv("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/924fe242a31e0239762f/raw/ea615f4a811a6e9e8a1fe95020a4407785181a21/2015_STAT545_enrollment.csv")
```

Here is an enrollment summary table for STAT545:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
summary(enrollment)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r barplot}

p <- ggplot(enrollment, aes(x =Subject, y = Masters, fill = Subject))

p + geom_bar(stat="identity") + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
